LONG DESCRIPTION

    Scaffold is project/directory orchestration utility for creating similiar/frequently created folder & file layouts.

    Use scaffold for creating coding projects you frequently create in the same way.

    How it works:

    For any layout of a directory you frequently use, or just want to template, scaffold effectively takes that directory,
    makes a snapshot of that directory, recursively, including any file's text and saves it as yaml

    Once a scaffold is created you can navigate to any directory and mount that saved scaffold to it.

    For example, assume there's a scaffold created for a `css:base` project, any directory you want to include all of that scaffolds folders, files, and layout you would mount it by:

    ```
    Mount-Scaffold css:base
    ```

    or multiple:

    ```
    Mount-Scaffold css:base, css:minify
    ```

    Other notable features included in Scaffold:

    -- Templating support
    -- YAML based orchestration
    -- Mount multiple scaffolds at once to a given destination
    -- PowerShell argument completer to remind you of the names you've added
